    - title: What's the value for me?
      description: >
        So, if you are a Full stack developer (or you are aspiring to become one)
        this mailing list will provide you every week 7 interesting articles to help you to
        stay relevant and hopefully learn some new cool tricks. Did we already
        say that it's for FREE?
    - title: Where do you get the content?
      description: >
        We hand pick what we believe are the best articles and posts around the
        web and then we leave the task of extracting the best 7 every week to a
        ranking algorithm that we developed.
    - title: Can I send feedback?
      description: >
